    "Also, you will apply various processes such as pre-processing, ***train-test spilit*** and ***cross validation*** that you will use in algorithm modeling and prediction processes in Python with ***scikit-learn***. \n",

    "Before diving into the project, please take a look at the determines and tasks.\n",

    "While starting you should import the necessary modules and load the data given as pkl file. Also you'll need to do a few pre-processing before moving to modelling. After that you will implement ***Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression,and Elastic-Net algorithms respectively*** (After completion of Unsupervised Learning section, you can also add bagging and boosting algorithms such as ***Random Forest and XG Boost*** this notebook to develop the project). You can measure the success of your models with regression evaluation metrics as well as with cross validation method.\n",

    "For the better results, you should try to increase the success of your models by performing hyperparameter tuning. Determine feature importances for the model.
